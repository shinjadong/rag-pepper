Dify supports connections to various external data sources. To ensure data security and access control, different data sources require appropriate authorization configurations. Dify provides two main authorization methods: **API Key** and **OAuth**.

## Accessing Data Source Authorization

In Dify, you can access data source authorization through the following two methods:

### I. Knowledge Pipeline Orchestration

When orchestrating a knowledge pipeline, select the data source node that requires authorization. Click **Connect** on the right panel.

### II. Settings

Click your avatar in the upper right corner and select **Settings**. Navigate to **Data Sources** and find the data source you wish to authorize.

## Supported Data Source Authorization

## Authorization Processes

### API Key Authorization

API Key authorization is a key-based authentication method suitable for enterprise-level services and developer tools. You need to generate API Keys from the corresponding service providers and configure them in Dify.

#### Process

1. On the **Data Source** page, navigate to the corresponding data source. Click **Configure** and then **Add API Key**.
2. In the pop-up window, fill in the **Authorization Name** and **API Key**. Click **Save** to complete the setup.
The API key will be securely encrypted. Once completed, you can start using the data source (e.g., Jina Reader) for knowledge pipeline orchestration.

### OAuth Authorization

OAuth is an open standard authorization protocol that allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their resources on specific service providers without exposing passwords.

#### Process

1. On the **Data Source** page, select an OAuth-supported data source. Click **Configure** and then **Add OAuth**.
2. Review the permission scope and click **Allow Access**.

#### OAuth Client Settings

Dify provides two OAuth client configuration methods: **Default** and **Custom**.

- Default
- Custom

The default client is primarily supported in the SaaS version, using OAuth client parameters that are pre-configured and maintained by Dify. Users can add OAuth credentials with one click without additional configuration.

**Process for Custom OAuth**
1. On the **Data Source** page, select an OAuth-supported data source. Click **Configure** and then the **Setting icon** on the right side of **Add OAuth**.
2. Choose **Custom**, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Click **Save and Authorize** to complete the authorization.
