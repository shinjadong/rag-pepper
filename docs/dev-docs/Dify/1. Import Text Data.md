If a knowledge base is set up to use online data, you won’t be able to add local documents later or switch it to a local file-based mode. This prevents a single knowledge base from mixing multiple data sources, avoiding management complications.

## Adding Data Later

If you haven’t prepared your documents or other content yet, simply create an empty knowledge first. You can then upload local files or import online data whenever you’re ready.
