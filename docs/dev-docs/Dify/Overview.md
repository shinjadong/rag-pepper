Now let’s get it to your users. Every Dify application becomes available in multiple ways automatically—choose what works best for your situation.

## Start with Web Apps

Your fastest path to sharing is through web apps. These are generated automatically when you create any application and work immediately without setup.

Web apps work on any device and automatically adapt to screen sizes. No app store approvals or installation required.

## Publishing Options

## How Publishing Works

When you publish an app, Dify creates a web app and API endpoint with your latest configuration:
- **Web apps** update immediately with new features and responses
- **API endpoints** serve the latest model and workflow configurations
- **Website embeds** (which display your web app) automatically reflect all changes
- **MCP servers** provide access to current app capabilities

Publishing replaces your live app with the current configuration. Users will immediately see changes in their next interaction.

## Choose Your Approach

Use **API Integration**. You control the interface, user authentication, and data handling. Your app becomes part of your product ecosystem.

Use **Embed on Websites**. Display your web app as a chat widget or inline frame on your current site. Works with any website technology.

Use **MCP Server**. Make your app available to Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other AI development environments as a native tool.

## Publishing Best Practices

Before you share your app, ensure you’ve configured these settings:
- **App description** - Helps users understand what your app does
- **Icon and branding** - Makes your app recognizable and professional
- **Access controls** - Decide if your app should be public or require authentication
- **Rate limits** - Protect your app from overuse (especially important for API access)

All publishing methods use the same app configuration. Set it once, publish everywhere.
