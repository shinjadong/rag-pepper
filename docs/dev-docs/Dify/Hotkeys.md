Speed up your workflow building with keyboard shortcuts.

**[Go to Anything](https://docs.dify.ai/en/use-dify/build/en/use-dify/build/goto-anything)**: Press `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) anywhere in Dify to search and jump to everything—apps, plugins, knowledge bases, even workflow nodes. Use slash commands like `/theme` to change appearance, `/language` to switch languages, or `/help` to access documentation.![Command+K search interface](https://mintcdn.com/dify-6c0370d8/pukb9aJrVFLyeNW1/images/command-k.gif?s=ce96fffdf58c3618168891ceeaded5e5)
